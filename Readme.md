S# Pet Adoption Project

## Description
The Pet Adoption Project is a web application that allows users to explore various pets available for adoption. Users can view pet details, sort them by price, and like their favorite pets. The application fetches data dynamically from an API, providing a seamless user experience.

1. **Dynamic Pet Loading**: Pets are loaded from an external API, ensuring the data is always up to date.
2. **Category Filtering**: Users can filter pets by category (e.g., Dogs, Cats) with a single click.
3. **Sorting by Price**: Pets can be sorted from highest to lowest price for easier comparison.
4. **Pet Details Modal**: Users can view detailed information about each pet in a modal popup.
5. **Like Feature**: Users can "like" their favorite pets, and these will be displayed in a dedicated section.

## ES6 Features Used
- **Arrow Functions**: Simplified function expressions for better readability.
- **Template Literals**: Used for constructing strings with embedded expressions, making HTML generation more straightforward.
- **Const and Let**: Block-scoped variable declarations to improve code clarity and avoid hoisting issues.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Simplified extraction of values from objects and arrays for better code organization.
- **Promises**: Used for handling asynchronous operations with the fetch API for improved code management and error handling.
